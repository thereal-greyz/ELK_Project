### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):
sudo adduser sam
sudo adduser joe
sudp adduser amy
sudo adduser sara
sudo adduser admin

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group:

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo groupadd engineers  

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): sudo usermod -G engineers sam sudo usermod -G engineers amy sudo usermod -G engineers joe
 

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir /home/engineers

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chown :engineers engineers/

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo wget https://downloads.cisofy.com/lynis/lynis-2.7.3.tar.gz 
man lynus

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man lynis

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis system audit

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
 What can I do?
    ---------------------
    Option 1) Check if a trusted user created the files (e.g. due to using Git, Homebrew or similar).
              If you trust these files, you can decide to continue this run by pressing ENTER.

    Option 2) Change ownership of the related files (or full directory).

       Commands (full directory):
         # cd ..
         # chown -R 0:0 lynis
         # cd lynis
         # ./lynis audit system
